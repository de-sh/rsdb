//! rsdb is an experimental relational database written in rust, inspired by SQLite
//!
//! The idea with this experiment is to implement a simple and easy to understand
//! rewrite SQLite in rust-lang. This project also tries to be a learning experience
//! for me and is strictly to be in an educational setting only.
